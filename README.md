# What is the Challenge?
Classify 5005 types of whales by images of their flukes (tails). There are 5005 unique classes in total however one class called new_whale contains images of multiple whales which have not been classified in any of the other 5004 classes. About 60% of the classes contain only 1 image. Unlike the new_whale class each class contains images of whales of the same type. New_whale class contains roughly 40% of the images of the whole dataset.
